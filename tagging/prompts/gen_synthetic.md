## Task Description

You are an AI assistant tasked with generating a set of mathematically equivalent answers to a given ground truth answer. These equivalent answers should maintain the same mathematical meaning while potentially varying in format, notation, or phrasing.

## Examples

Below are examples of questions with their ground truth answers, followed by equivalent answers that preserve the mathematical meaning. 

**Example 1 (Order-Insensitive):**
<question>Determine all real values of $x$ for which $(x+8)^{4}=(2 x+16)^{2}$.</question>
<ground_truth_answer>-6,-8,-10</ground_truth_answer>

<equivalent_answer_1>-8, -10, -6</equivalent_answer_1>

**Example 2 (Latex Expression):**
<question>A bag contains 3 green balls, 4 red balls, and no other balls. Victor removes balls randomly from the bag, one at a time, and places them on a table. Each ball in the bag is equally likely to be chosen each time that he removes a ball. He stops removing balls when there are two balls of the same colour on the table. What is the probability that, when he stops, there is at least 1 red ball and at least 1 green ball on the table?</question>
<ground_truth_answer>$\\frac{4}{7}$</ground_truth_answer>

<equivalent_answer_1>4/7</equivalent_answer_1>

**Example 3 (Variable):**
<question>If $T=x^{2}+\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$, determine the values of $b$ and $c$ so that $x^{6}+\\frac{1}{x^{6}}=T^{3}+b T+c$ for all non-zero real numbers $x$.</question>
<ground_truth_answer>-3,0</ground_truth_answer>
<model_answer>b=-3, c=0</model_answer>

<equivalent_answer_1>b=-3, c=0</equivalent_answer_1>
<equivalent_answer_2>b = -3, c = 0\</equivalent_answer_2>

**Example 4 (Paraphrase):**
<question>Peter has 8 coins, of which he knows that 7 are genuine and weigh the same, while one is fake and differs in weight, though he does not know whether it is heavier or lighter. Peter has access to a balance scale, which shows which side is heavier but not by how much. For each weighing, Peter must pay Vasya one of his coins before the weighing. If Peter pays with a genuine coin, Vasya will provide an accurate result; if a fake coin is used, Vasya will provide a random result. Peter wants to determine 5 genuine coins and ensure that none of these genuine coins are given to Vasya. Can Peter guaranteedly achieve this?</question>
<ground_truth_answer>Petya can guarantee finding 5 genuine coins.</ground_truth_answer>

<equivalent_answer_1>Yes, Peter can guarantee finding 5 genuine coins while ensuring that none of these genuine coins are paid to Vasya.</equivalent_answer_1>

## Input

<question>
{{QUESTION}}
</question>

<ground_truth_answer>
{{GROUND_TRUTH_ANSWER}}
</ground_truth_answer>

## Output

Please generate at least 5 mathematically equivalent answers to the ground truth answer. Each answer should be placed inside tags like <equivalent_answer_1>...</equivalent_answer_1>, <equivalent_answer_2>...</equivalent_answer_2>, etc.
